# Autonomous Game Playing AI Agents

This repository contains implementations of AI agents designed to play games autonomously using various machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques.

## Overview

This project explores the development of intelligent agents capable of learning and mastering different types of games without human intervention. The agents use techniques like reinforcement learning, deep learning, genetic algorithms, and other AI approaches to develop game-playing strategies.

## Features

- Implementation of various AI algorithms for game playing
- Training frameworks for autonomous agents
- Performance evaluation tools
- Example applications in different game environments
